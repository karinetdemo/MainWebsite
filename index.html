        <h3>Lonely tips</h3>
        <h4>Airports & Airlines</h4>
<p class="LPT">
International flights arrive at Yangon (Rangoon; RGN; www.ygnia.com), Mandalay (MDL; www.mandalayairport.com) and Nay Pyi Taw (NPT; www.nptia.com) airports. The most common route to Yangon is via Bangkok, though there are regular direct flights with several other regional cities including Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p class="LPT">
<em>Tickets</em>
<br>
Airlines offer discounted tickets via the internet depending on how far in advance you book. Good deals are often available from Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur and Singapore on budget airlines such as AirAsia and Silk Air. If you're flying around the region, look into Bangkok Airways Discovery Airpass (www.bangkokair.com).
<br>
In Myanmar you can buy international tickets from travel agents or online.</p>

<h4>Departure Tax</h4>
<p class="LPT"><br>
Myanmar locals pay K500, but foreigners pay $10 departure tax, which is not included with your air ticket. Have the US dollars in hand when leaving the country. You pay at the window in the entrance hall, before you check in. Kyat are not accepted. There is no departure tax for domestic flights.<br>

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <h3>before revolution</h3>
        <p>Myanmar was ruled with an iron fist long before the current regime came to power. From the early 19th century until WWII, the insatiable machine that was the British Empire held sway over Burma. Before the British, there were the kings of old, who rose to power by eliminating rivals with claims to the throne. Tracing the conflicts back to the 9th century, we find the Himalayan Bamar people, who comprise two-thirds of the population, at war with the Tibetan Plateau’s Mon people. The fight went on for so long that by the time the Bamar came out on top, the two cultures had effectively merged.
<br>
The 11th-century Bamar king Anawrahta converted the land to Theravada Buddhism, and inaugurated what many consider to be its golden age. He used his war spoils to build the first temples at Bagan (Pagan). Stupa after stupa sprouted under successive kings, but the vast money and effort poured into their construction weakened the kingdom. Kublai Khan and his Mongol hordes swept through Bagan in 1287, hastening Myanmar’s decline into the dark ages.

        <h3>since 2005</h3>
        <p><strong>Aung San Suu Kyi </strong>was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 and was finally released from house arrest in July 1995. She was arrested again in 2000 and held in her home until the UN brokered her unconditional release in May 2002. She was rearrested in May 2003 and released in November 2010 by the military authorities. During her arrest, Aung San Suu Kyi continually refused offers of freedom in exchange for exile from the country and, despite an ongoing debate in the pro-democracy movement over future strategy, her stature throughout Myanmar is as great as ever. In moves symbolic of the positive momentum in the country, in 2011 Suu Kyi left Yangon for the first time in eight years, and in May 2012 Suu Kyi entered the lower house of the Burmese parliament as an MP. Much more remains to be done, but the hope is that <em>decades of isolation may be coming to an end</em>.
